About Me:

Mike Ward

I've been programming since the late 1900's :). I started with punch
cards, moved on to Systems Programming, then Desktop Applications and
most recently Web front-ends. I'm the original author of Hyper Terminal,
the Telnet application that shipped with Windows 95 (my 15 seconds of
fame). I also run several open source projects including, VSColorOutput
(a Visual Studio extension), Desk Drive, Tweetz and Markdown Edit. All
these and more can be found at: <https://github.com/mike-ward>
